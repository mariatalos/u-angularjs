# Angular JS
The purpose of this practices it's to Train **Front End** developers to follow best practices **improving** their logical thinking through progressive enhancement and make them feel **comfortable** about asking questions and discussing possible solutions.
### Who is a mentor?
Your mentor is a Sr. level developer who has about 0.5-1 hour a day allocated specifically to answer your questions and review your code.  His goal is to help you clear your doubt, check your code to make sure he improves your way of thinking and problem solving.  He also makes sure that you are following best practices.  he gives you feedback and makes sure you are on the right track. If you feel lost, if you are not sure what you are doing is correct, feel free to ask him openly. That is why they are here, to **help YOU!**
	
### How do I interact with my mentor?
1) **Daily meeting:**	Your mentors are obligated to meet with you at least 15 minutes a day. You will explain to your mentor, what you did yesterday, what you are going to do today and if you have any questions. Ask him when would be the best time to meet with him everyday. During the day,Write your questions in a list and ask them in your daily.   Remember no question is too simple not to ask :)						
							
2) **Resolving blockers/bugs by your mentor:**		You will have to have at least 2 meeting of half an hour with your mentor.  The idea of this meeting is that your mentor helps you to unblock your issues or your bugs.  He will explain you what is the solution and best practices.  He will pick the practice that thinks you need to learn about and will do peer programming with you.
